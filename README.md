# Whiteboards.io schema

This is the place where the data format, used internally to represent items on a board for [Whiteboards.io](https://whiteboards.io/) app, is documented. A JSON file created according to the schema presented here can be used as an input file to "restore" operation on [Whiteboards.io](https://whiteboards.io/) and turned into a fully functional board.

You can use that to create your board programmatically or convert other boards into a board on [Whiteboards.io](https://whiteboards.io/).

## Current implementation status
This is in-progress and while it doesn't document all the supported properties, it tries to aim for at least the minimal subset required for every object type, to make it usable on a [Whiteboards.io](https://whiteboards.io/) board.
